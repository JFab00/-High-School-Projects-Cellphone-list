# [HighSchool Projects] Cellphone list

# Title of the project: **Cellulare**

In this school project we had to emulate a software that gives you the details on mobilephones/smartphones(that you had to choose) using Java.  
  
The project had the following requirements:  
- A cellphone class that had **Brand**, **Model**, *OS*, *Type* (as in smartphone or not), *Dimensions*, *Price* and *Image*
- An .csv file that will rappresent the database of the project and in which the smartphones would be stored
- A function that would delete a certain smartphone
- A function used for the searching system
- A function that would add a mobilephone/smartphone in the list (it would also add it in the "database")
- A function for editing the details of a cellphone
- A function that would exit the software and would save the changes.

The left and right red arrows would let you scroll thorugh cellphones.  
The "-" button is for deleting the cellphone you're looking at.
The search bar and button, would try to find if a certain Model is in the databse.  
If the cellphone is in the databse...

And if it isn't...

The "+" button would let you add a cellphone to the "database".  
We didn't had the image upload through the software as a requirement, so in order to add the image of the cellphone you had to manually drag and drop it in the "immagini" (images) folder, and in the software you had to write the name of the image(as well as its extension)

If "Modifica Cellulare" is pressed, the textarea above becomes editable and you can change the details of the cellphone.

The project overall is lacking in comparison with a professional software, but for me it turned out pretty well (managing to get a high mark on the project, ~8/9 if I reckon).  
Obviously the aim of the project was not making it professional, the aim was getting a high mark.  
If you find this project, and it helps you with your school project, you can take it... but make sure you understand the code and don't just drag and drop... also because it's in italian and that could reveal the fact that you copied it from the internet. ðŸ˜…  
Just don't try to make money out of it, also because it's really ugly and I don't know who would buy it from you...
